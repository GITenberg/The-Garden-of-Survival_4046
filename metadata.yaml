description: Twins may be similar in outward appearance and share genetic material,
  but the paths they take in life are often markedly divergent. That's certainly the
  case in Algernon Blackwood's The Garden of Survival, in which two twin brothers'
  adventures take them to opposite ends of the earth & ndash; though their special
  bond remains intact.
